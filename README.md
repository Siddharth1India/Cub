## ✨ About

**Cub** is a minimalist, static-style blog generator built with **Flask**.  
It lets you write posts in Markdown and publish a clean, fast, privacy-friendly blog that you can host anywhere.

Think of it as a self-hosted alternative inspired by Bear Blog’s simplicity.

> ⚠️ Note: [Bear Blog](https://bearblog.dev/) is doing incredible work as a hosted platform - 
> if you don’t need self-hosting, you should definitely consider using Bear itself.
